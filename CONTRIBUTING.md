# Contributors guide

This project is a community project for the Python Discord community over at https://discord.gg/python. We will be providing support for those of you who are new to Git, and this project is to be considered educational. Server staff and event handlers from the Discord server will, in the spirit of the Hacktoberfest event, be creating issues on this repo which can be solved by members of the community. Pull requests will be reviewed and eventually accepted as long as they follow the rules outlined below.

# Rules

* Your pull request must solve an issue created by a staff member or event handler. These will be labeled with the `approved` label.
* Only staff may create issues for you to solve, although you are free to suggest issues of your own, which staff can choose to approve. If your issue is approved, the `approved` label will be applied to the issue.
* Pull requests that do not solve an open issue, for issues that have already been solved, or that are low-effort will be marked with the `invalid` label, which will ensure that they do not count towards your 5 Hacktoberfest PRs.
* You must be a member of our Discord community in order to contribute to this project. 

# Installation & Dependency Management

Hacktoberbot utilizes [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation and dependency management. For users unfamiliar with the Pipenv workflow, a [Pipenv Primer](https://github.com/discord-python/hacktoberbot/wiki/Hacktoberbot-and-Pipenv) is provided in Hactoberbot's Wiki.
