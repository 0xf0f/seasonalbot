# hacktoberbot
A community project for [Hacktoberfest 2018](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com). A Discord bot primarily designed to help teach Python learners from the PythonDiscord community how to contribute to open source.

You can find our community by going to https://discord.gg/python

## Motivations
We know it can be difficult to get into the whole open source thing at first. To help out, we've decided to start a little community project during hacktober that you can all choose to contribute to if you're finding the event a little overwhelming, or if you're new to this whole thing and just want someone to hold your hand at first.
